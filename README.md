🚀 Project Roadmap & Milestones
This repository follows a structured development path covering three phases of enterprise .NET engineering. 
Each phase focuses on specific architectural patterns and modern deployment strategies.

Phase 1: Core Foundations
System Architecture: In-depth exploration of the .NET Ecosystem, comparing .NET Framework, .NET Core, and the unified .NET 5+ platform.
Object-Oriented Programming: Implementation of advanced C# concepts, focusing on SOLID principles, Encapsulation, and Polymorphism.

Phase 2: Intermediate Implementation
Full-Stack Web Development: Engineering responsive web applications using the ASP.NET Core MVC architecture and Razor engine.
Security & Identity: Implementing robust Authentication and Authorization protocols, including JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and OAuth 2.0.

Phase 3: Advanced Cloud & Microservices
Distributed Systems: Designing Microservices-based architecture with inter-service communication via RabbitMQ and containerization using Docker.

Azure Cloud Operations: Deploying scalable solutions via Azure App Services and automating delivery with CI/CD pipelines.
